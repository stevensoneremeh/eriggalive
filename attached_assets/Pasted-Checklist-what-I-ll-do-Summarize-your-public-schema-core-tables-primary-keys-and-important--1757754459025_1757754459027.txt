Checklist — what I'll do:

Summarize your public schema: core tables, primary keys, and important columns.
List existing foreign-key relationships that affect a community redesign.
Explain why the "profile_id does not exist" error occurs and mapping options.
Give clear, minimal migration / design suggestions and safe SQL examples you can run.
Schema breakdown (summary)
Note: I inspected your public schema. Below are the important tables and their key columns / relationships relevant to a community page redesign.

public.users

Primary key: id (uuid)
Other important columns: auth_user_id (uuid, references auth.users.id), username, full_name, email, avatar_url, coins (bigint), reputation_score, created_at, updated_at
Role: main app-level user record (not the auth.users table). Many tables reference this table by user id.
public.user_profiles

Primary key: id (uuid)
Unique column: user_id (uuid) — references auth.users.id and has unique constraint
Columns: bio, profile_image_url, social_links, privacy_settings, created_at, updated_at
Role: additional profile metadata. This is the canonical place for profile-specific fields in your current schema.
public.community_posts

Primary key: id (bigint)
Key columns: user_id (uuid) — author (references public.users.id), category_id, content, vote_count, comment_count, is_published, is_deleted, created_at, updated_at
Role: posts in the community.
public.community_comments

Primary key: id (bigint)
Key columns: post_id (bigint), user_id (uuid), parent_comment_id, content, created_at
Role: comments on posts.
public.community_post_votes

Primary key: id (bigint)
Columns: post_id (bigint), user_id (uuid), created_at
Role: who voted on which post.
public.community_comment_likes

Primary key: id (bigint)
Columns: comment_id (bigint), user_id (uuid), created_at
Role: who liked which comment.
public.community_categories

Primary key: id (bigint)
Columns: name, slug, description
Role: categories for posts.
public.media_items

Primary key: id (bigint)
Columns: title, media_url, media_type, required_tier, created_at
Role: media related to posts or vault.
Other helpful tables that appear in relationships

store_purchases, products, orders, order_items (ecommerce)
memberships, membership_tiers, payments (subscriptions)
vault_views (media view tracking)
radio_* tables (broadcasts, queue, history)
admin_users, user_roles (admin access)
user_subscriptions, subscription_plans
Important relationships (direct ones relevant to community)
community_posts.user_id -> public.users.id
community_comments.user_id -> public.users.id
community_post_votes.user_id -> public.users.id
community_comment_likes.user_id -> public.users.id
user_profiles.user_id -> auth.users.id (unique)
Several tables reference auth.users via foreign keys (bank_accounts, radio_queue.added_by, radio_broadcasts.created_by, etc.)
Why "column 'profile_id' does not exist"
Your schema does not have a column named profile_id on the community or user tables. Code or SQL that assumes there is a profile_id column (for example: community_posts.profile_id, post_votes.profile_id, or references in functions/policies) will raise that error.
In your schema profile-related data is stored under user_profiles.id and/or under public.users.id (and user_profiles.user_id links to auth.users). The app code or SQL should reference one of these existing columns instead of profile_id.
How to map profile_id in your app redesign
You have two straightforward mapping options — choose based on how your frontend expects to identify a profile:

Option A: Treat users.id (public.users.id, uuid) as the single identity for community features.

Pros: Already used by most tables (community_posts.user_id, votes, comments).
Cons: If you plan to strictly separate auth data vs public profile metadata, you may want to keep profiles separate.
Option B: Use user_profiles.id as profile_id and make community tables reference it.

Pros: Keeps profile metadata separate from public.users if you need multiple profile versions or advanced mapping.
Cons: Requires updating many tables / constraints / application code to use profile primary key instead of user_id. Also care: storing foreign tables in public can bypass RLS.
Option C (minimum-invasive): Keep existing user_id references and add a helper view or function that provides profile info when the frontend asks for profile_id.

Recommended immediate actions (safe, minimal)
Fix code/SQL to use existing columns:
Replace references to profile_id with user_id (community tables) or with user_profiles.id depending on chosen mapping.
If frontend expects profile_id, create a non-destructive mapping view (safe):
Create a view that exposes a profile_id column derived from user_profiles.id or users.id. Views for API access must include with (security_invoker=on).
Ensure RLS policies use auth.uid() and indexes exist on columns used in policies (user_id/user_profiles.user_id).
Test vote/comment functions as an authenticated user to confirm no profile_id references remain.
Safe SQL examples you can run
Quick checks to find code that references profile_id (run in SQL editor):

SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'profile_id';
SELECT table_schema, table_name, routine_name FROM information_schema.routines WHERE routine_definition ILIKE '%profile_id%';
(These are read-only checks to find references in schema and functions.)
Create a read-only view exposing profile_id (non-destructive):

Note: If you want this exposed via Supabase API, materialized views are sensitive — avoid them in public schema. A plain view with security_invoker is OK.
Example (run only if you want a profile_id alias): CREATE VIEW public.user_profile_map WITH (security_invoker=on) AS SELECT u.id AS user_id, up.id AS profile_id, u.username, u.full_name, up.profile_image_url, up.bio FROM public.users u LEFT JOIN public.user_profiles up ON up.user_id = u.auth_user_id; -- After creating this view you can let your frontend query profile_id from this view.
Create a helper function to translate profile_id -> user_id (or vice versa):

Example (non-destructive): CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_user_id_from_profile(p_profile_id uuid) RETURNS uuid LANGUAGE sql STABLE AS $$ SELECT user_id FROM public.user_profiles WHERE id = p_profile_id; $$;
Use this for server-side translations rather than rewriting all client code immediately.
Specific recommendations for the community page redesign
Use public.community_posts.user_id as the canonical author id in frontend state. Show profile info by joining with public.user_profiles (via user_profiles.user_id -> auth.users.id OR matching public.users.auth_user_id).
When rendering avatars/names: join community_posts.user_id -> public.users.id and then LEFT JOIN public.user_profiles on public.user_profiles.user_id = public.users.auth_user_id to get profile_image_url and bio.
Replace any client-side references expecting numeric profile_id with uuid paths (if you move to user_profiles.id then revise routes accordingly).
Keep vote/comment tables referencing user_id (uuid). Avoid adding duplicate profile_id columns unless you have a clear migration plan.
Ensure authentication flow returns auth.uid() (uuid) and that your client passes that to functions or uses it for permissioned API calls.
Next steps I can take for you
Option 1 (quick fix): I can generate SQL to create the view public.user_profile_map and helper functions to translate profile <-> user ids so your frontend can transition safely.
Option 2 (migration): I can draft a migration that adds a profile_id column to community tables and populates it from user_profiles (this is destructive/structural — I will ask explicit confirmation before running).
Option 3 (audit): I can scan your DB functions and policies for leftover references to profile_id and produce a patch list (non-destructive report).
Tell me which option you want:

"Create view & helper" (safe; I will produce the SQL statements).
"Audit references" (report only; I'll search routines/policies for profile_id occurrences).
"Migrate schema to add profile_id" (I will prepare a careful migration SQL but will ask you to confirm before executing).

Improve my admin dashboard, scaffold an MVP **admin dashboard** with the following requirements: 1. **Authentication & Authorization** - Use Supabase Auth. - Only allow the user with email `info@eriggalive.com` to access `/admin`. - Protect `/admin` on both client and server; redirect unauthorized users to `/login`. 2. **Admin Dashboard** - Accessible at `/admin` after authentication. - Provide a sidebar or top navigation with links to manage: - Homepage content (hero, featured sections) - Merch (CRUD products: name, price, stock, image) - Media (upload/browse images, audio) - Radio (manage live stream links & schedules) - Videos (Chronicles & Vault categories, CRUD titles, descriptions, URLs) - Tiers (subscription levels, pricing, permissions) 3. **Data Modeling** - Supabase tables: - `homepage`: id, title, body, image_url - `merch`: id, name, price, stock, image_url - `media`: id, type (image/audio), url, metadata - `radio`: id, title, stream_url, schedule - `videos`: id, category (chronicles/vault), title, description, url - `tiers`: id, name, price, permissions (JSON) 4. **MVP UX** - List views with inline Create/Edit/Delete. - Simple forms or modals for editing. - Confirmation before delete. - Toast notifications for success/error. 5. **Tech Stack** - Next.js App Router + TypeScript. - Supabase JS client for queries. - Tailwind CSS for styling. Please generate: - File structure for `/app/admin/*`. - `layout.tsx` with auth guard + navigation. - `page.tsx` as dashboard home. - One full CRUD example (e.g., merch). - Example Supabase queries for secure read/write. Keep it minimal but functional — I want a working MVP admin panel that lets the `info@eriggalive.com` user manage the entire platform. --- This prompt is short enough to feed into Replit/v0 but still gives them the structure to generate working code. Would you like me to also draft the Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies you’ll need so that only `info@eriggalive.com` can actually write to those tables? That way your admin isn’t just protected at the UI level but also at the database level.

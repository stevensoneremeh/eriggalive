continue from twhere we stoppedReasonedReasonedQuick clarification neededI don't see the previous message content in this chat—can you remind me what we were working on or paste the last assistant message you want me to continue from?If you prefer, tell me one of these and I’ll continue immediately:The last task (e.g., "write RLS for projects table", "deploy Edge Function X", "run SQL to list users")The last SQL/Edge-function snippet you want me to editThe specific goal (inspect schema, create policy, deploy function, etc.)Once you confirm, I will proceed.I think the last one, then I also sent a prompt for you to help me avoid loosing my supabase account cause I am exceeding my quota usage I belive as a result of egress, I would also prefer the admin dashboard to make use of the second backend. I was thinking to use Neon for the second database. The goal is to ensure I can continue using this account and I can share the workload with Neon database, also on my dashboard and admin dashboard, its takes time to load, it also keeps twitching or rather some data keeps refreshing and blinking. I need my entire platform to be balanced and fully functional. Since you have access to my entire schema and know my goals I want you to go through the entire schema and make the best decision for the work load share with Neon database and the most easiest way I can go about it.ReasonedI will list all tables (public and relevant schemas), list installed extensions, and list Edge Functions to gather context before recommending a split. I'll run three quick calls: list_tables, list_extensions, list_edge_functions.Ran list_tablesReasonedI'll list installed extensions and Edge Functions next. I'll call list_extensions and list_edge_functions with no inputs.Ran list_extensionsRan list_edge_functionsReasonedSummary of current state (quick)I inspected your schemas and tables in auth, storage, realtime and public. Key app tables live in public (users, community_posts, community_comments, media, videos, game_sessions, etc.). Auth data is in auth schema; storage in storage schema.Installed extensions include useful items for cross-db work: notably dblink, postgres_fdw, and http. Also pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_monitor for query monitoring.You have two Edge Functions deployed: user-avatar-manager and signed-upload-avatar.All good — now recommendations and an actionable plan to reduce egress/quota pressure, stabilize the dashboard, and split workload between Supabase and Neon.Goals you statedAvoid losing Supabase account due to quota/egress overuse.Offload part of database workload to a Neon Postgres instance.Improve dashboard & admin dashboard performance (blinking/refreshing).Keep the platform balanced and fully functional with minimal changes to app code.Design principles for splitting workloadsKeep Auth, Storage metadata, and Realtime on Supabase to preserve Supabase managed features (Auth + Storage + Realtime tightly coupled with Supabase services).Move heavy analytics, long-term historical data, and large read-only datasets to Neon (or another dedicated DB). Also move large-scale reporting queries and expensive aggregations.Avoid moving tables that rely on Supabase-managed functions/triggers or RLS tied to auth claims unless you handle auth-jwt verification and RLS replication carefully.Use read replicas/federation patterns to minimize cross-provider egress: prefer pushing data from Supabase -> Neon (replication/scheduled ETL) rather than the app fetching from two databases per request.Minimize cross-query joins between Supabase and Neon to avoid per-request egress.Candidate tables to move to Neon (recommendation)High priority to move:realtime.messages_* (if these are being archived daily) — older message partitions / archivesanalytics / audit logs (e.g., auth.audit_log_entries) — large and append-onlyany table used for heavy reporting or BI — e.g., pageview / event logs (if you have them)historical snapshots / backups you keep for long termlarge media metadata if used for analytics (not the files — files stay in Supabase Storage/S3)*_Keep on Supabase (recommended):auth.* (users, sessions, refresh_tokens)storage.* (buckets, objects)realtime.* (live messages and realtime tables needed by clients)public.* tables that are part of core app flows requiring low latency writes (community_posts, community_comments, game_sessions, user-facing content) Rationale: Supabase Auth and Storage integrate with RLS, Functions, and Realtime; moving them will require more rework.Two practical approaches (pick one or hybrid)Option A — Scheduled ETL / Archive (safer, minimal app changes)Keep primary (writes + reads for app) on Supabase.Create scheduled jobs that export/replicate large datasets or old partitions to Neon daily/hourly.Use Supabase pg_cron or an Edge Function + background worker to push batched data to Neon via postgres_fdw/dblink or via application job.On Neon, run analytics, BI, and long-running reports.Benefits: no cross-provider per-request egress; minimal changes to app code. Low implementation risk.Option B — Split reads to Neon (more advanced)Keep writes on Supabase. Stream frequent inserts (e.g., events) to Neon asynchronously.Read-heavy, non-auth-protected pages load from Neon (dashboard analytics, admin reports).Implement a read-routing layer in your server/Admin dashboard:Admin UI uses Neon connection for analytics endpoints.App UI continues using Supabase for user-facing data.Benefit: reduces Supabase read/egress. Requires changes to dashboard/backend to query Neon.I recommend Option A as the simplest and safest start.Implementation plan (step-by-step) — Option A (ETL/archive)Provision Neon DB and create a user/DB for analytic data.I assume you’ll set up network/security and obtain connection string.Create schema on Neon that mirrors only the tables you plan to archive.Start with auth.audit_log_entries, public.* large tables (if they are archival), and realtime.* archive tables.Implement secure transfer method:Preferred: Use a Supabase Edge Function (TypeScript Deno) that runs on a schedule (via pg_cron or external scheduler) to:Query new rows since last sync using indexed timestamp (e.g., created_at > last_synced_at).Push rows to Neon using a single multi-row INSERT via Neon connection string.Alternative: Use postgres_fdw or dblink if outbound connections from Supabase managed Postgres are permitted (check policy). Note: dblink may require configuration and security considerations.If using Edge Function, it avoids DB-level egress from Supabase managed Postgres but will incur egress from the Edge Function host—cheaper and controlled.Create minimal indexing on the Supabase source tables for the sync key (e.g., created_at).Use pg_cron (installed) or Edge Function + background worker to run sync job hourly/daily depending on load.On Neon, set up retention, partitioning, and OLAP-optimized indexes. Use Neon for BI/dashboards.Validation and metrics:Add logging and a row-count comparison check after each sync.Track egress by sampling before/after. Start with conservative sync frequency.Addressing dashboard blinking/refreshing & slow loadsLikely causes:Admin dashboard repeatedly polling expensive queries (counts, aggregations).Realtime subscriptions or client-side polling fetching large datasets.Heavy queries without proper indexes causing timeouts.Fixes:Move heavy aggregation endpoints to Neon (or cache results).Add caching layer for admin dashboard queries:Use Redis or in-DB materialized views refreshed periodically (e.g., every 1–5 minutes).For Supabase-only solution, create materialized views in Supabase and refresh on schedule with pg_cron.Avoid client polling on every second; use websockets/realtime for incremental updates or increase polling interval.Identify the expensive queries using pg_stat_statements / pg_stat_monitor (we have these extensions). Run the top slow queries and optimize indexes.I can write SQL to fetch top queries; want me to run it?RLS, Auth & NeonDo NOT move tables that rely on auth.uid() based RLS unless you re-implement RLS on Neon and implement safe service-role access patterns.For Neon analytical queries, access will be from a service role or via analytics user — keep it read-only and separate from user-level auth.Security & cost controlsOn Neon, enforce network-level rules and a read-only user for analytics.On Supabase, keep service_role secrets restricted.Add alerts/budgets in Supabase dashboard for egress/storage.Use signed URLs for large file downloads so that files in Storage are served directly from CDN/S3 rather than via your DB.Minimal changes to your appKeep primary app database usage unchanged.For admin dashboard:Add a config that points analytics endpoints to Neon.Replace expensive API endpoints with calls to Neon-backed analytics endpoints or cached materialized views.For archival/backup: use background sync; no app changes required.Next concrete actions I can take for you (choose any)A. Create an Edge Function template that connects to Neon and performs incremental sync. I will generate the function code (Deno TypeScript). (I will need Neon connection string from you.)B. Create pg_cron job SQL to run incremental exports (if you prefer to run on DB). This will require confirmation before I execute.C. Run analysis on Supabase to surface top 10 heaviest queries using pg_stat_monitor/pg_stat_statements. I can run the SQL and summarize. (I already see pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_monitor installed — shall I run?)D. Create materialized view + pg_cron refresh SQL for admin dashboards (I can propose SQL for the main counts: total_users, active_sessions, posts/day, comments/day).E. Propose exact table list to archive (I can prepare a recommend list based on row counts / sizes — I can query approximate table sizes if you want).Which of A–E would you like me to do first? If you pick A or B I'll need the Neon connection details (or permission to provide the template only). If you want C, I will run the monitoring queries now to find hotspots.
